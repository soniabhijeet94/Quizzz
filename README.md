# Quizzz...
It's a quiz player app for Android, which comprises of interesting and exciting questions from a disparate collection of themes with smooth UI. For using this app, just install the attached .apk file into mobile phone. On the launch, you can select the theme as well as the level of questions you want to attempt. Then there will be 10 consecutive questions, after which there is a login page, which on successful login shows the complete statistics of your attempt, like total attempts, no. of correct/wrong attempts as well as rank on the leaderboard table. But at this stage, it's not on internet,so it's server is local. So you can't login at present. Will let you know once it's online.
